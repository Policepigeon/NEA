<an idea for a social media that optimises for user return rate and minimising user time spent>
this will help people to feel as if they're getting a better balance on socials
but still maximise engagement.

the user can set how much time they want on per day, but they never get a hard cap, only things like slower loading and soft blocks to stop them using the site
