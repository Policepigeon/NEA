What if I made a Point-of-sale system that was both free and open source?


Features that I want:
    Free
    Allow the user to check stock levels #(User have to manually input what is bought and sold?)
    Allow purchase of stock/tracking of purchases
    Low stock notification
    Shows the location of stock on the shelves #(would have to allow the user to map their room or use only shelves, with labels for rows/columns)
    Bestsellers by:
        Volume sold
        Profit
        In the local area? #(This would require a p2p soloution and so may not be possible)
    Create paper round lists
    Allow tracking of who orders which paper, and where they live
    Allow tracking of bread/custom orders
    Manage sale of items #(Would help with tracking stock levels)

    Mobile app?
        Would allow customers to make, manage and modify bread/paper/custom orders
        Would allow the shop to increase its customer base by showing stock levels to customers
        #(later) Show customers prices in their local area?
        Allow customers to see whether their packages are ready to be picked up


Features that the customer wants:
    Jo Eames:
        Less verbose interface
        More direct shortcuts, instead of a roundabout way to get to things
            [Use multiple different homepages - eg: a newspaper tab, as well as a statistics tab and a stock tab, including a overview homepage instead of 
            multiple submenus]
